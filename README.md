# Peter Pan's Calculator v1.0

## Overview
**Peter Pan's Calculator v1.0** is a web-based calculator designed to perform a wide range of mathematical operations. The calculator supports basic arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithms, percentage conversions, temperature conversions, and quadratic equation solving. It also includes graphing, geometry, and algebra modes.

This project is built using **HTML, JavaScript, and CSS**, providing an intuitive and interactive user interface.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`×`), and division (`÷`).
- **Trigonometric Functions**: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan` (with degree conversion).
- **Logarithmic Functions**: `log` (natural logarithm).
- **Power & Root Operations**: Squaring (`x²`), cubing (`x³`), square root (`√`).
- **Scientific Constants**: `π` (Pi) and `e` (Euler's number).
- **Percentage Calculations**: Convert values to percentages (`x to %`) and vice versa (`% to x`).
- **Temperature Conversion**: Convert between Celsius (`to℃`) and Fahrenheit (`to℉`).
- **Data Analysis**: Compute sum, average, max, and min of a series of numbers.
- **Graphing Mode**: Allows users to plot mathematical functions.
- **Geometry Mode**: Solves unknown sides and angles in triangles.
- **Quadratic Equation Solver**: Solves quadratic equations of the form `ax² + bx + c = 0`.

## Installation & Usage
### Installation
No installation is required. Open `index.html` in any modern browser to use the calculator.

### Usage
1. Open the **calculator webpage**.
2. Click buttons to input expressions or functions.
3. Press `=` to compute results.
4. Use the **mode switch button** to toggle between:
   - **Calculator Mode** (Basic and scientific calculations)
   - **Graphing Mode** (Enter and plot functions)
   - **Geometry Mode** (Solve for triangle properties)
   - **Algebra Mode** (Quadratic equation solver)
5. Click **AC** to clear the display.

## Known Issues
- The calculator may not work if **JavaScript is disabled** in the browser.

## Future Improvements
